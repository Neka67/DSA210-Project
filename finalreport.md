# 🌍 Air Pollution & Health: Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction

Air pollution is a major global public health concern, linked to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and overall health burden.  
Fine particulate matter (**PM2.5**) in particular has been widely studied for its detrimental effects on human health.

In this project, we explore the relationship between **PM2.5 air pollution levels** and **health outcomes** across multiple countries from **2015 to 2019**.

### 🔍 Our analysis includes:
- Cleaning and merging environmental and health datasets
- Conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends
- Formulating and testing **statistical hypotheses** to assess the strength and nature of the relationships
- Applying **machine learning models** (e.g., KNN, logistic regression, K-means clustering) to make predictions and uncover structure in the data

### 🩺 Health indicators investigated:
- **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rates**
- **Death rates attributable to air pollution-linked diseases**
- **Proportional burden of pollution-linked deaths** relative to all-cause mortality

By combining descriptive visualizations, statistical testing, and machine learning techniques, this study aims to better understand whether worsening air quality correlates with deteriorating health conditions globally — and to what extent these impacts can be detected within a five-year timeframe.
