Project Proposal: The Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health Over Time

Name: Nehir Kazancı

1. Introduction & Motivation

Air pollution is a major environmental and public health concern, linked to respiratory diseases and overall illness burden. While many studies focus on a single point in time, this project aims to analyze how changes in air pollution levels over the past five years impact public health. By studying trends in air pollution and respiratory illness rates, I hope to determine whether increasing pollution leads to a rise in health issues over time. This research could provide valuable insights for policymakers to emphasize the importance of air quality regulations.

2. Data Sources

To conduct this study, I will use publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reliable sources:
	•	Air Pollution Data: WHO Global Air Quality Database – PM2.5 concentration levels across different countries from the last five years.
	•	Health Data: WHO Global Health Estimates – Respiratory disease mortality rates, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and age-standardized illness rates over the same period.

3. Data Collection & Processing
	1.	Obtain yearly air pollution and health data (2014-2018) from WHO
	•	Download PM2.5 air pollution levels for multiple countries.
	•	Retrieve annual respiratory disease statistics (mortality rates, DALYs, age-standardized rates) for the same countries.
	2.	Preprocess and merge datasets
	•	Align data to ensure consistency (e.g., matching country names and time periods).
	•	Handle missing values and ensure all measurements are in comparable units.
	3.	Analyze trends and correlations over time
	•	Time Series Analysis: Plot trends in pollution and illness rates over five years to identify patterns.
	•	Regression Analysis: Check if increases in pollution levels predict increases in respiratory disease burden.
	•	Lag Effect Investigation: Determine if pollution levels from previous years influence current illness rates.
	•	Comparative Analysis: Compare illness rates in countries with increasing vs. decreasing pollution levels.

4. Expected Outcomes
	•	Identify whether increasing air pollution over time is associated with a rise in respiratory illnesses.
	•	Determine whether there is a lag effect, where pollution changes take a few years to impact health.
	•	Provide visualizations (trend lines, scatter plots, heatmaps) to illustrate the relationship between pollution and health trends.

By analyzing this relationship over multiple years, this study will contribute to understanding long-term health impacts of air pollution and support efforts to promote cleaner air policies worldwide.
