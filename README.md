Project Proposal: The Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health

Name: Nehir Kazancı

1. Introduction & Motivation

Air pollution is a significant environmental and public health issue, contributing to various diseases, particularly respiratory illnesses. The goal of this project is to examine whether higher air pollution levels correlate with an increased burden of respiratory diseases and overall ilness. By analyzing global data, I aim to understand the extent to which air pollution affects people’s health and quantify its impact. This research can help highlight the importance of environmental policies aimed at reducing pollution and improving public health outcomes.

2. Data Sources

I will collect data from the World Health Organization (WHO):
	•	Air Pollution Data: WHO Global Air Quality Database, focusing on PM2.5 concentrations by country.
	•	Health Data: WHO Global Health Estimates, specifically respiratory disease mortality rates, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and age-standardized rates.

3. Data Collection & Processing
	1.	Retrieve data from WHO platforms
	•	Download air pollution data (PM2.5 levels) for all countries.
	•	Extract respiratory disease statistics, including mortality rates and DALYs, for all countries.
	2.	Clean and merge datasets
	•	Ensure both datasets use consistent country names and time frames.
	•	Handle missing values and standardize units for comparison.
	3.	Analyze correlations
	•	Investigate the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory illness burden using statistical tests (correlation analysis, t-tests).
	•	Compare high-pollution vs. low-pollution countries to see if respiratory disease rates differ significantly.

4. Expected Outcomes
	•	Identify whether countries with higher pollution levels experience a higher proportion of respiratory illnesses.
	•	Determine if air pollution has a stronger effect on respiratory diseases compared to general illness rates.
	•	Provide visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps) to illustrate findings clearly.

This study will contribute to understanding how air pollution impacts health and provide insights into the need for pollution control policies.
